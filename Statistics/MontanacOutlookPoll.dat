The data contain the outcomes for two items in the Montana Economic Outlook Poll conducted in May 1992, with accompanying demographics for 209 out of 418 poll respondents. The items are whether the respondent feels his/her financial status is worse, the same, or better than a year ago, and whether the respondent views the state economic outlook as better over the next year. Respondents are classified by age, income , political orientation, and area of residence in the state.
